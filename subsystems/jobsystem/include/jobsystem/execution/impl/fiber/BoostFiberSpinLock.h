 *
 * @note Normal std::mutex implementations only work on the thread-level and do
 * not recognize fibers, causing various errors on different platforms.
 *
 * @note The Boost.Fiber library also provides their own mutex implementation
 * for the same purpose. However, for some reason, it only works with fibers and
 * cannot handle normal threads (blindly high-jacks their contexts, resulting in
 * deadlocks and undefined behavior).
